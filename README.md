# ðŸŽ®Tic Tac Toe Flutter AppðŸŽ®

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Flutter and Dart for two players, featuring background sound. This project demonstrates the use of the Flutter framework along with `flame_audio` for sound effects and `flutter_launcher_icons` for custom app icons.

## ðŸŽ®Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

tic_tac_toe/   
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ lib/  
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ [main.dart](./lib/main.dart)   
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ [home_page.dart](./lib/home_page.dart)  
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ [pubspec.yaml](./pubspec.yaml)   
â””â”€â”€ README.md  


- **`lib/main.dart`**: The entry point of the application.
- **`lib/home_page.dart`**: The main page where the game is played.

## ðŸŽ®Dependencies

This project uses the following external dependencies:

- **`flame_audio: ^2.10.1`**: For playing background sound and sound effects.
- **`flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.13.1`**: For custom app icons.

## ðŸŽ®Getting Started

To get started with the Tic Tac Toe Flutter app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoe_flutter.git
    cd tictactoe_flutter
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Ensure you have Flutter installed. Then, run:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the app:**

    You can run the app on an emulator or physical device using:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## ðŸŽ®Configuration

1. **Setting up `flutter_launcher_icons`:**

   Configure your app icon in the `pubspec.yaml` file under the `flutter_launcher_icons` section. For example:

    ```yaml
    flutter_launcher_icons:
      android: true
      ios: true
      image_path: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"
    ```

   Replace `assets/icon/app_icon.png` with the path to your app icon image.

2. **Playing Background Sound:**

   Make sure to place your audio files in the appropriate assets directory and configure them in `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    flutter:
      assets:
        - assets/sounds/background_music.mp3
    ```
